I guess you're here because you're interested in knowing more about me. First off I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to check out this website.

I'm a Computer Science student getting ready to graduate from the University of Iowa with a passion for technology and its utilization to innovate for the future. After I graduate I'm looking to move out west out of the midwest where the weather is wonderful and the people are pleasant. In my free time I like to spend time playing video games (League of legends, Call of Duty, and Runescape), going for bike rides, and working on improving ideas I have in my thought lab. During the times where I'm on the clock I enjoy working on software development with a particular interest in improving security of consumers. As I continue to work on this blog I'll likely provide tips on how you can improve your security and privacy online. By no means will what I say make you secure, because security doesn't happen over night and it provides no guarantees of protection, but my tips could be the difference between someone targeting you or moving on. I often have perspectives to share on many different aspects of life outside of security as well, so feel free to check out my other topics in my thoughts section.

I also considered myself an aspiring entrepreneur always looking for opportunities to innovate. The idea I am working on currently is a blockchain for identities that addresses the issues of Self-Sovereignty, Single Sign on, while preventing sybil attacks. Although I don't have a post up on this in my projects section, one will be coming soon to provide more details. Be sure to check back soon if you're interested in learning more about this project!

For a more up to date view into what's going on with me feel free to check out my social media links provided on my home page. I am usually most active on twitter.

Thanks again for stopping by!
