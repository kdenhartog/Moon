I guess you're here because you're interested in knowing more about me. First off I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to check out this website.

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Iowa with a passion for technology and its utilization to innovate for the future. After I graduate I'm looking to move out of the midwest to California. In my free time I like to spend time playing video games (League of legends, Call of Duty, and Runescape), going for bike rides, skiing, and working on improving ideas I've come up with or been inspired by.

During the times where I'm on the clock I enjoy working in security and software development to improve the security and experience of consumers and enterprises alike. I also considered myself an aspiring entrepreneur always looking for opportunities to innovate.

I've also recently been on a trip to Tanzania and India, which has been an amazing experience that's broaden my views on the world and inspired me to travel more. Hopefully, I can get around to visiting all 7 continents and learning how humans are both similar and different in other parts of the world.

For a more up to date view into what's going on with me feel free to check out my social media links provided on my home page. I am usually most active on twitter.

Thanks again for stopping by!
