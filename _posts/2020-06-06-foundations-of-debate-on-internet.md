The nature of discussion and debate is a foundational aspect of any democratic society, but what happens when the democratic society stops using the tool in good faith? This question appears to be the basis of a lot of the problems that exist within our society, so naturually my curiosity wants to dig into the problem further. As I dug, I came to a relatively intuitive conclusion that social media and the way the websites have been designed is the cause for our increased distrust between our fellow humans. However, I think I may have some ideas on how to improve debate in modern society. With some minor tweaks to our design goals of social media platforms, I believe we can leverage social media as a tool for robust discussion and debate in society to scalably discuss our shared values and how we'd like to change our shared values when the time has come to do so.

At it's core, debate is a method humans use to resolve conflict and achieve consensus between one or many parties. Often times, our values are a point of conflict because they're often based upon past experiences, intuitions, and being shared in a lossy communication channel (language - I'll have to do a separate blog post on this later). Since our values are intrinsicly independent from others, when we come to work together, it's useful that we identify shared values to accomplish a shared goal more efficiently. It's in these times when we're working to identify shared values that we use debate as a tool to work towards consensus. This is inherently good, even though debate can sometimes lead to tense times. I hypothesis that the reason debate can turn intense is because the format and the rules of the debate have been structured in a way that aren't conducive to creating a foundation of trust between the participating parties. Even worse, some formats (such as modern social media platforms) are structured (both intentionally and unintentionally) in a way that allow bad-faith participants to disrupt trust between good faith participants leading to the problems we're seeing today in modern society. So what do we need to do to build platforms that ackowledge and discourage (this teeters on the line of using technology to impose my values. See more about that idea in ["Tech isn't a Tool to Impose Values"](./2019-04-04-tech-no-impose-values.md)) these tradeoffs?

First off, for a productive debate to occur all participants have to establish a shared desire to achieve consensus. Without this shared desire, the debate won't go anywhere. Next up, a good faith debate is far more likely to produce consensus when the participating parties establish mutual trust between each other. So why is it so difficult to establish trust on social media such that we can conduct debate on the internet?

Trust doesn't exist in a vaccum though when attempting to debate. Participants should take into consideration the degree of prior interactions that have been shared between the other parties because these past shared interactions could have established shared trust between the participants from past experiences. Additionally, participants have to ackowledge the shared prior experiences which may sow distrust. I'm sure there's other points of considerations too, but I've chosen to focus on these because points because I think they most significantly affect trust between participants on social media. More specifically, social media creates an environment where we get family members, work colleagues, friends, releative acquantences, and even sometimes total strangers debating between each other creating a chaotic basis to form any level of trust between the participants.

This combination of participants makes it very unlikely that the majority of participants have shared prior experiences, and in some cases allow people who have prior distrust to engage in a public forum. This is a problem. We should be looking for ways to improve our social media platforms that establish a good basis of trust on the internet. Once we've got that we've set ourselves up for a good foundation to conduct a good faith debate (and even just fun conversations) on the internet.

To make my point more clear, social media has a complete lack of regard for who particpates in discussions opting to instead allow anyone who can see the discussion to participate; This needs improved. Additionally, social media platforms should be looking to improve via indicators to remind readers that miscommunication is more likely to occur via social media and intent is often lost during rapid, asynchronous discussions. Another point of improvement that social media platforms can improve is how authors are being informed of their impact on their audience. Let's break these points down a bit further though.

Looking at: "social media has a complete lack of regard for who particpates in discussions opting to instead allow anyone who can see the discussion to participate"
Today,

P1
Debate is a method to resolve conflict
But, debate has it's tradeoffs too.

P2
In order to successfully debate, all participating parties must be working to achieve consensus
In order to achieve consensus, all participating parties must share a mutual basis of trust

P3
Therefore debate can only exist in a medium that's conducive to enabling mutual trust

P4
So why is it so difficult to establish trust on social media such that we can conduct debate on the internet?

P5 Sub Conclusion
We should be looking to improve the basis of trust on the internet so it can be an effective medium for debate by doing:

P6
creating platforms that increase reinteraction between parties to enable higher likelihood of trust fostering

P7
Ackowledge miscommunication is more likely to occur and remind users of this to improve reader trust

p8
Notify authors when a message has been read and allow readers to signal impact on the audience to improve authors trust

P9
prompt call to action to A/B Test around design goals of increased trust on a discussion platform

P10
Summarize

With these small actions, I believe we can transform social media from a platform that operates as a platform to monetize discussion to a platform that creates a foundation of mutual trust in society, so we can use it to discuss our shared values and re-evaluate our shared values when necessary.
