The idea of free will has been explored for quite some time. It is a question of philosophy that stretches across many different disciplines because it strikes at the center of our own personal universes. As I was reading about different dimensions, I began to explore the theoretical physics of time to explore the current thinking. As I was thinking about this, I came across a thought experiment that can be run, if the tachiyon particles are discovered. This explores those ideas.

Let's say that a person we're able to use a tachiyon antitelephone to send a message back in time to themselve. Contained in this message is a point in time of which the message receiver should send a message back in time again to themselves. If the receiver continues to receive a message a finite number of times the person has free will because at one potential variant of time event lineage, a person chose to not send a message. This is an exhibit of free will. However, if an infinite number of messages are received, then this is a display of lack of free will. This is based on the assumption that there are an infinite number of time event lineages.
